    <strong>Just to forewarn:</strong> this is primarily a roast. I have immense respect for philosophers like Kant and Wittgenstein. I’ve also always wanted to write a post in the style of <em>Scorched Earth Policy</em> on Twitter. As three Tauruses in my life have made three equally life-ruining decisions for me, I think this sign deserves it. Those individuals were quite boring too, so I added a few I've read. I genuinely appreciate my kind Taurus friends who are sweet and supportive. This is just me fighting back against those people—and the darker Taurus archetypes—who attacked me when I was weak, vulnerable, and naively trusting. (Don't mess with someone whose chart is one-third Scorpio.)

            <p>To understand the Taurus, it helps to describe things in terms of agriculture: grazing, harvesting, devouring, and long-term storage. Their life revolves around consumption, where profound existential questions are just another pasture for them to graze on to keep things minimally interesting. Show them you possess brains and watch them raze up the hill with all the grace of a combine harvester trying to glean whatever insight they can from you. They experience such gleeful satisfaction in quoting a generic cliche, with the triumph of voice indicative of someone who just solved the hard problem. The way they find miracles in the obvious is a miracle in and of itself.</p>

            <p>And quite a few prowl around in philosophy. Wouldn't their doomed tryst with the obvious lead to statements, such as that of Wittgenstein, that the world is-whatever is like, right there. Indeed, the sheer certainty with which he proclaims to have solved all of philosophy surfaces, because look here, it's like written in a language! It's just a language problem! Didn't anyone realize this?</p>

            <p>There are consequences to being utilitarian for too long, and one of those is mistaking the tool for the thing it's working on. A calculus of pleasure isn't as much of fun thing to do, is it? Pretty run of the mill, I'd say. And next we have Machiavelli… uh, never mind.</p>

            <p>They do have their moments of generosity, though, ones which led Marx to give free advice on how they could create an economic system where he could make money for existing.</p>

            <p>Of course, it took a Taurus to farm aura points by leeching the ideas of a Scorpio ascendant like Nietzsche, while turning his revitalizing philosophy into a diktat. Do you think a moral Taurus like Kant wandering around the clock will save you? The guy doesn't care about your desires at all; he'll leave you wanting for the rest of your life just so that he can look great in front of everyone.</p>

            <p>One must forgive their repeated attempts to plow into and destroy metaphysics; the field is simply beyond them.</p>

            <p>Despite their idealism-or rather, a more digestible form of their elitism, they have a hidden obsequiousness about them. They are easily subservient to whoever or whatever they deem as The Ideal. The bull will fashion an ideal if they don't have one, assume what is perfect for them is right, and then impose that ideal on everyone. (Kant was so upset by people lying to him, dude made it everyone's problem.)</p>

            <p>Do the beautiful women manage to redeem this sign? Someone as gorgeous as Sabrina Carpenter sure helps bring beauty into the world, and textbook sexuality is honestly quite cute as well. They do come off as benevolent saviours of the world, caring to a fault, it makes you doubt…</p>

            <p><em>Wait a minute,<br>
            Is this not the Hunger Games?</em></p>

            <p>What plentiful fruit, and sweet morning air!<br>
            But like the arena in the Quarter Quell, the most beautiful, inviting meadow is also a slow poison, and he is not Peeta Mellark. They use comfort as an entrapment device, and once you're cozy and juiced up enough for their mother to like you, they add you to their little collections of possessions. Their fluffy exterior is what they offer in payment for extracting as much as they can from you, be warned-they are the best emotional manipulators of the zodiac. They keep you comfortable and complacent to keep themselves safe so that you don't threaten them. Gaslighting is second nature to them as they thrive on controlling the narrative, along with you. Most of them create a facade of mystery, which I've noticed comes with omitting insignificant details, to hide the fact that they are actually quite tedious, and the control is there to prevent you from leaving when you figure that out.</p>

            <p>They are reliable to keep around if you're susceptible to death anxiety. They are quite comforting and not scared of such a thing, and why would they be? When divorced from the pressures of the world, it might even be a continuation of their preferred state, which is, of course, stagnation.</p>

                <div class="addendum-title">Some Claude add-ons I liked when discussing with her:</div>
                <p>They fatten you up emotionally until you're too comfortable to fight back, then they butcher whatever made you interesting in the first place. You become another trophy in their collection of broken things they've 'improved.'</p>
                <p>Calling Sabrina a Taurus plant lol</p>
